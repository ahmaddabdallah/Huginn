## ⚙️ How Huginn Works (Simple Explanation)

When you have a COFF `.o` file, Huginn loads and runs it directly in your computer's memory. Here’s what happens inside, without getting technical:

1. The program reads the file content without saving it anywhere on your disk.
2. It sets up a safe environment in your computer’s memory to run the file.
3. It quietly cleans up after itself, so no leftover data affects your system.

This process avoids common risks like leaving temporary files behind or causing memory leaks.
